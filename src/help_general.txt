            When using the standard rom, this is the program file, i.e. the name
            of the file to be loaded and executed. The expected format is PHX 
            (with no parity checks enforced). OCB format not available yet.

  OUTPUT    The name of the file attached to the tape punch peripheral device.
            If not specified, the filename specified in the locus16.ini TapePunch 
            peripheral is used by default.

  -h, --help         Show this help message and exit.

  -s, --sleep        Specifies the number of instructions executed before a 1 micro-second

                 peripherals (tape punch, tape reader, terminal).
